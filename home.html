        <h2>Further developments</h2>
        <div class="shade">
          <p>To further enhance its functionality, we are planning to integrate a GPS tracking system that allows caregivers or family members to monitor the user's location in real-time. This ensures added safety, especially in unfamiliar environments. Additionally, an emergency call mode will be included, enabling the user to quickly alert a trusted contact or emergency services if they become lost or encounter difficulties.
            <br>
            <br>
            A camera module is also in development to provide additional situational awareness. This feature will assist users in avoiding high-risk areas, such as heavy traffic zones, by analyzing the surroundings and offering guidance to safer routes.
            <br>
            <br>
            By combining these features, the device aims to provide users with greater independence, safety, and confidence in their daily activities.</p>
